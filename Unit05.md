**Unit 5: States of Matter** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, we will build upon what we have learned in the previous
units in order to learn how matter behaves. Because the behaviors and
properties of gases are often described in straightforward equations, we
will begin with gases. We will also study the phase diagram, which
predicts the state (i.e., solid, liquid, or gas) of any group of
molecules at any given temperature and pressure.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 21.25 hours.

     Instructions: Read this webpage. Ideal gas laws are laws that apply
    to gases that behave “ideally,” when molecules take up no volume and
    have no attractive forces between one another. In the real world,
    however, no gas behaves ideally. However, gases are closest to being
    ideal when they are high-temperature and low-pressure.
