**Unit 1: Matter and Measurements** <span id="1"></span> 
*Our first step in this course is to gain a basic understanding of
matter and define the basic terminology used to describe matter. This
unit will also provide you with a refresher on measurements, as much of
this class will require you to express quantities in standard units and
amounts. We will also learn about significant figures, which may be a
new concept for those of you who have not yet taken a science course.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 9.75 hours.

    Matter”](http://resources.saylor.org/CHEM/CHEM101/CHEM101-1.1.1.1-ClassificationAndPropertiesOfMatter-BY-SA_files/CHEM101-1.1.1.1-ClassificationAndPropertiesOfMatter-BY-SA.html#S1A)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read the “Extensive and Intensive Properties”
    section. Remember that extensive properties, such as volume and
    mass, rely on the “extent” to which matter is present. Intensive
    properties, such as density and viscosity, are independent of the
    quantity of matter and are inherent to the matter.

     Instructions: Read the “Physical and Chemical Properties” section.
    Note that, because the two properties of matter are closely related,
    the distinction can become difficult to discern; however, for our
    purposes, we will define a physical property as one that can be
    observed without changing the matter’s composition.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read the “Solids, Liquids, and Gases” section. Note
    the differences between these three phases of matter on both the
    microscopic and macroscopic level. Solids, like wooden blocks, have
    definite shape and definite volume, and the particles are ordered
    and close together. Liquids have definite volume and indefinite
    shape, meaning they take on the shape of the container. Imagine the
    differences between iced tea in a pitcher versus in a glass. A
    liquid’s particles are less ordered, but still relatively close
    together. Gases, such as the air inside balloons, have indefinite
    shape and indefinite volume and their particles are highly
    disordered.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read the first two sections: “So What Is Density?”

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read this webpage. Notice the distinctions made
    between heat and temperature. While both deal with kinetic energy,
    the energy of motion, “heat” refers to thermal energy transfer,
    while “temperature” is a measure of the kinetic energy of a system.
    Potential energy, the energy of position, in chemistry usually
    refers to the energy stored in chemical bonds. This material will be
    discussed in more detail in Unit 6.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read the “How do we classify matter?” section. All
    matter can be classified as either a pure substance or a mixture.
    Furthermore, for a pure substance a subcategory of either single
    element or compound can be applied. Mixtures are further categorized
    as either homogeneous (e.g., single phase) or heterogeneous (e.g.,
    multiple phases). The distinction between homogeneous and
    heterogeneous mixtures presented here is dependent on phase, or
    physical, boundaries. This section also contains material relevant
    to the next section of the course.  
      
     Reading this section should take approximately 1 hour and 30
    minutes.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read the “Chemical Composition” section. Keep in mind
    that mixtures, whether homogeneous or heterogeneous, can be
    separated by physical means into pure substances. Techniques of
    separation were discussed in the previous section. Pure substances
    comprise elements and compounds.  
      
     Reading this section should take you approximately 45 minutes.

**1.1.6 Chemical versus Physical Changes** <span id="1.1.6"></span>

    Link: Stephen Lower’s *General Chemistry Virtual Textbook*: [“What

     Instructions: Read the “Chemical Change,” “Energetics of Chemical
    Change,” and “Dynamics of Chemical Change” sections. The energetics
    of chemical change will be discussed more thoroughly in Unit 6,
    while the dynamics of chemical change are a topic for
    [CHEM102](http://www.saylor.org/courses/chem102/). To determine if
    you are dealing with a physical or chemical change, ask yourself if
    you can reverse the process to recover the original material. For
    example, ice melting is a physical change, because you can re-freeze
    the water; however, cooking a steak is a chemical change, because
    you cannot recover the raw meat.  
      
     Reading these sections should take you approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: Read “The SI Base Units” and “The SI Decimal
    Prefixes” sections. Note that the base unit for mass (kg) is the
    only “base” unit with a prefix. This arises from the fact that the
    “gram” is so small (i.e., a nickel weighs approximately 5 grams)
    that “real world” objects cannot feasibly be measured in grams. Can
    you imagine how many grams a table would weigh? Also, with the
    exception of seconds, the SI system (System International) is a
    base-10 system, allowing easier conversion between units.  
      
     Reading these sections should take you approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: Read the “Uncertainty Is Certain!” section. Be aware
    that every measured value contains some uncertainty in the last
    digit. For example, if you are using a ruler to measure length, it
    is necessary to interpolate between gradations given on the ruler.
    This gives the uncertain digit in the measured length. While there
    may not be much deviation, what you estimate to be the last digit
    may not be the same as someone else’s estimation.  
      
     Reading this section should take you approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: Read the “Scatter and Error in Measured Values”
    section. While error is inherent to measurement, some errors are
    easier to detect and/or eliminate.   
      
     Reading this section should take you approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Read the “Accuracy and Precision” section. Imagine
    accuracy as hitting the “bulls-eye” on a dartboard every time, while
    precision corresponds to hitting the “triple 20” consistently. As
    another example, consider an analytical balance has a calibration
    error such that it reads 0.24 grams too high. Then even though
    measuring identical mass readings of a single sample would mean
    excellent precision, the accuracy of the measurement would be
    poor.  
      
     Reading this section should take you approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: Read this webpage. The concept of significant
    figures, commonly referred to as “sig figs,” is important when
    solving scientific math problems and should be carefully observed!
    The rules for significant figure rounding of addition and
    subtraction calculations are the same, but different than those for
    multiplication and division.
