Course Syllabus for "CHEM101: General Chemistry I"
--------------------------------------------------

This chemistry survey is designed to introduce students to the world of
chemistry.  The principles of chemistry were first identified, studied,
and applied by ancient Egyptians in order to extract metal from ores,
make alcoholic beverages, glaze pottery, turn fat into soap, and much
more.  What began as a quest to build better weapons or create potions
capable of ensuring everlasting life has since become the foundation of
modern science.  Take a look around you: chemistry makes up almost
everything you touch, see, and feel, from the shampoo you used this
morning to the plastic container that holds your lunch.  In this course,
we will study chemistry from the ground up, learning the basics of the
atom and its behavior.  We will use this knowledge to understand the
chemical properties of matter and the changes and reactions that take
place in all types of matter. **This course provides students the
opportunity to earn actual college credit. It has been reviewed and
recommended for 3 credit hours by [The American Council on
Education](http://www.acenet.edu/Pages/default.aspx) (ACE). While credit
is not guaranteed at all schools, we have
[partnered](http://www.saylor.org/partner-schools/) with a number of
schools who have expressed their willingness to accept transfer of
credits earned through Saylor. You can read more about our ACE program
[here](http://www.saylor.org/student-credit-pathways/ace/).**

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

-   define chemistry;         
-   distinguish between the physical and chemical properties of matter;
-   distinguish between mixtures and pure substances;
-   describe the arrangement of the periodic table;
-   perform mathematical operations involving significant figures;
-   convert measurements into scientific notation;
-   explain the law of conservation of mass, the law of definite
    composition, and the law of multiple proportions;
-   summarize the essential points of Dalton’s atomic theory;
-   define what an atom is;
-   describe electron configurations;
-   draw Lewis structures for molecules;
-   name ionic and covalent compounds using the rules for nomenclature
    of inorganic compounds; and
-   explain the relationship between enthalpy change and the tendency
    for reactions to occur.

### Course Information

Welcome to CHEM101: General Chemisty 1.  General information about this
course and its requirements can be found below.  
  
 **Course Designer:** Joanna Smithback, Ph.D. and [Rachel
Lerebours](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-h-n/#DrRachelLerebours)  
  
 **Primary Resources: **This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials. This course combines the resources listed below
for a series of readings and corresponding mini-lectures.  Unit
assessments were developed by the Saylor Foundation.

-   Stephen Lower’s: [General Chemistry Virtual
    Textbook](http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtext/virtualtextbook.html)
-   Khan Academy: [Chemistry
    Lectures](http://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry)

**Requirements for Completion: **This course comprises a variety of
lectures and reading materials.  Assessments with answer keys are found
at the end of each unit to assist you in the mastery of each section. 
To successfully complete this course, you must score at least a 70% on
the cumulative final.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take approximately 94 hours to
complete, exclusive of the final exam.  The 50-question exam should take
no more than 2 hours.  
  
 **Tips/Suggestions:** The material in this course is progressive.  If
you find that you are having difficulty understanding some of the
concepts, it is suggested that you revisit the previous unit of this
course or review the information contained in the prerequisite courses. 
A printed periodic table—containing element names, symbols, and atomic
masses—and a calculator are also suggested for use throughout this
course. They are also allowed to be used on the final exam.
