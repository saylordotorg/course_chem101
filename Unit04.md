**Unit 4: Chemical Formulas and Equations** <span id="4"></span> 
*We will now introduce the major tool you will need when solving
chemistry problems: the ability to write out formulas and equations. In
this unit, you will build upon your understanding of molecules and
bonding and begin to name and write compounds. We will then learn to
write out and balance chemical equations. Equations enable us to
describe chemistry topics in mathematical terms and predict the outcomes
of reactions. For example, if we turn 1 kilogram of ice into pure steam
at 200 Celsius and sea-level air pressure, what is the volume of steam
created? Writing the reaction out in the form of an equation will allow
us to precisely calculate the answer!*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 11.25 hours.

     Instructions: Read this webpage, which explains what information
    chemical formulas reveal and how to derive chemical equations from
    experimental data. This is one of the most math intensive units in
    General Chemistry, but it is not as tricky as it may seem at first.
    Follow the method.  
      
     Reading this webpage should take you approximately 2 hours.

     Instructions: Read this webpage. “Nomenclature” is a fancy word for
    the process of naming compounds. The more you practice
    systematically naming compounds, the easier it will become. Here,
    primarily inorganic substance nomenclature is covered. While organic
    nomenclature is introduced here, it will be covered in more detail
    in Organic Chemistry.  
      
     Reading this webpage should take approximately 2 hours.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read this webpage, which explains what information is
    given in a balanced chemical equation. Although balancing may seem
    easy, it can become quite difficult when there are multiple
    reactants and/or products. As a general rule, begin balancing the
    chemical equation with a unique atom, or one that is only found in
    one reactant and one product. Balance hydrogen and oxygen last; they
    usually present the biggest challenge. You must learn to properly
    balance equations, as you will need this skill in every chemistry
    course you take.  
      
     Reading this webpage should take you approximately 2 hours.
