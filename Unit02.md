**Unit 2: The Atom** <span id="2"></span> 
*Now that we have a basic understanding of matter, we will delve into
the basic unit of matter: the atom. The atom (along with its protons,
neutrons, and electrons) serves as the starting point for the study of
chemistry. Scientists have studied atoms for hundreds of years and have
developed a number of different models in order to describe them. At
present, chemists use the quantum mechanical model, which has been
around for decades. The “laws” of this model continue to intrigue and
spark debate among scientists today. One particularly interesting
theory, for example, states that it is impossible to know the exact
location and velocity of an electron at the same time! *

     Instructions: Read the “Elements” section. Elements get their names
    from many sources. The “new” elements are purely synthetic and are
    usually named by the scientist who develops them. What would you
    name an element?

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read this webpage. The Bohr model of the atom
    introduces orbitals and explains the observation of atomic line
    spectra. Orbitals are regions of space where electrons orbiting the
    nucleus of an atom can reside. Atomic line spectra is
    electromagnetic radiation, or light energy, associated with electron
    redistribution among pairs of orbitals.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read this webpage. This material covers electron
    configurations and the arrangement of the periodic table. An
    electronic configuration is a listing of the occupancy of an atom’s
    electrons amongst its orbitals. The periodic table was purposefully
    designed to reflect the chemical nature of each element. Metals, for
    example, are on the left-hand side, while noble gases are on the
    right. Halogens are always to the immediate left of the noble gases.
    By the end of this section, you should be able to identify these and
    other groups on a periodic table. Remember that a group is a
    vertical column, while a period is a horizontal row.  
      
     Reading this webpage should take approximately 1 hour and 30

     Instructions: Groups on the periodic table are important because
    elements within a particular group, in general, have similar
    chemical properties and reactivity. Ionization refers to the process
    of removing an electron from an atom. Ionization energy pertains to
    the energy supplied to facilitate this process. Watch these three
    lectures to reinforce the concepts covered in the reading
    assignment.
