**Unit 6: Thermochemistry and Thermodynamics** <span id="6"></span> 
*In this unit, we will take a look at energy as it relates to chemistry
and chemical reactions. We will study both thermochemistry, which deals
with the temperature- and heat-related aspects of chemistry, and
thermodynamics, which focuses on the overall energies associated with
chemical reactions. Thermodynamics will ultimately lead us to the Gibbs
free energy equation, which can tell us whether any chemical reaction is
spontaneous or not (i.e., whether it occurs by itself, without any
external help).*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit will take you approximately 15 hours.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read this webpage. Using bond energy to calculate the
    enthalpy of reaction is not particularly accurate because energies
    are affected by each molecule’s unique surroundings, such as
    intermolecular forces. For this reason, energies are only an average
    across many different reactions.The first law of thermodynamics will
    be discussed in more detail in subunit 6.2.1.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read this webpage. The first law of thermodynamics is
    sometimes referred to as the law of conservation of energy. It
    states that energy can be neither created nor destroyed, but it may
    change form. For example, imagine a campfire: the energy is stored
    in chemical bonds in the wood, and is released as light and heat.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read this webpage. This material gives a detailed
    description of entropy and how it relates to the system and
    surroundings. The third law of thermodynamics deals with a
    theoretical absolute zero state, which is a physical
    impossibility.

     Instructions: Read this webpage. The Gibbs free energy equation
    predicts whether a reaction will happen spontaneously or not. Gibbs
    free energy applies to reactions of every magnitude, from water
    freezing to industrial chemical processes. It is important to note
    that whereas a reaction may be predicted to be spontaneous, the
    reaction rate may be very slow however.
