**Unit 3: Bonding** <span id="3"></span> 
*Bonds are connections between atoms. (Note that although we will focus
on bonds in this unit, there are additional forces that affect atoms,
i.e., intermolecular forces.) A solid grasp of VSEPR (Valence Shell
Electron Pair Repulsion) theory will help us understand how elements
that differ by one or two atomic numbers behave similarly or
differently. VSEPR theory explains that the number of electrons an
element possesses is intimately tied to its chemical properties. For
example, though sodium differs from both neon and potassium by just one
atomic number, it is extremely different from neon but very similar to
potassium. This is because neon is a stable element with eight valence
electrons (as predicted by VSEPR theory). Sodium and potassium have one
and two valence electrons, respectively, which explain why they are
similar to one another but quite different from neon. VSEPR is also used
to predict the 3-dimensional structure, or geometry, of molecules.*

     Instructions: Read this webpage. A covalent bond in a molecule, the
    most commonly occurring type, happens when each atom undergoing
    bonding contributes one electron to a shared electron pair. This
    material also introduces resonance structures. Resonance occurs when
    more than one correct Lewis structure can be drawn.

    contributes none. Metallic bonding occurs when many electrons occupy
    a large region of space and their atoms are cationic sites to
    balance overall charge.
